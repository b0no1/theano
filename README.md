> Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. It can use GPUs and perform efficient symbolic differentiation.

This repository tracks my progress in learning theano, my notes on theano and implementation of toy examples
